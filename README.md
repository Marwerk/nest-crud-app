Annotations are a form of metadata that we can add to our code. In TypeScript, annotations provide additional information about the code to the compiler/dev tools. They don't affect the runtime behavior of the code directly but can influence how the core is processed/compiled/interpreted
Type annotations are a specific kind of annotation that provide type information. For example, in "id: string", the ": string" part is a type annotation telling TypeScript that "id" should be treated as a string.
